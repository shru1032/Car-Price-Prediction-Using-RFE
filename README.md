# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-RFE

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. In this project I have used the vast dataset, "CarPrice.csv" for the prediction of Car Prices with complete EDA and using Recursive Feature Extraction (RFE) and building a Linear Model using the statsmodel.
